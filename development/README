= libyaml Development

Welcome!

The directory contains extra content for development of libyaml. It should only
exist on branches and should not be merged to master.

All libyaml development should be done on branches. GitHub commit/push will be
granted liberally. Stop by #yaml on irc.freenode.net.

== Quick start

    $ git clone https://github.com/yaml/libyaml.git
    $ cd libyaml
    $ ./developent/test

== Testing

Testing libyaml requires the pyyaml repository. The tests are all in the
pyyamlrepository.

The following script will make sure that everything is set up correctly and run
the tests for you:

    $ ./developent/test

== PyYAML

Note that changes to libyaml should be replicated in ../pyyaml/lib and
../pyyaml/lib3 for Python and Python3 respectively.

== NOTE

There is an unsolved problem where the build system will pick up a system
libyaml instead of the development one. For now make sure there is no system
libyaml. Patches (very much) welcome.
